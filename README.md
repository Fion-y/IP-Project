# MyWorkroom

MyWorkroom is an educational platform that seeks to inspire and push students to collaborate and build relationships with their peers. With the freedom to customise their own Avatar, students will be motivated to finish their activities quickly. With each completed activity, they gain stars which they can exchange for clothing for their Avatar. They also gradually unlock furniture in their rooms with each task. This excites them since they do not know what they will unlock next.  
 
## Design Process

 This website's colour palette leans towards pastels and cool colours. Upon doing research, we found that blue was a colour that stimulates productivity. On top of that, pastel colours are more pleasing and easier on the eyes. We decided to use the radial gradient design as it is usually used in graphics that promotes meditation and calmness. We decided on rounded edges as it was not harsh on users. We kept our user's age range in mind and strived towards a minimalistic looking website, without too much graphics but at the same time, attracting students to use it often. At the start of the project, we wanted to implement the design of kindergarten assets like crayons and very straightforward visuals but then we realise it doesnt align with our ideas.

### User Stories
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
- As a student, I want to use a platform that will motivate me, so that I can get more work done.
- As a competitive student, I want to be able to know where I stand among those in my cohort, so that I can keep improving on my studies.
- As a creative student, I would use this platform so that I can have freedom to casually express my creativity.

### Credits and Inspiration

Our overall idea was to integrate Bondee into Brightspace. We can get the students going with this kind of reward system.  

#### Brightspace (politemall) 
- The learning materials and Assignments/CAs 
- This platform is used very frequently by students hence we thought it should at least be engaging. This keeps their momentum and motivation high as they will have something to look forward to after completing a task.  

#### Bondee 
- Bondee is a social-networking application which allows friends and acquaintances to connect and show off their own customised avatar and room.  
- More about Bondee: https://www.prestigeonline.com/sg/pursuits/tech/what-is-bondee-avatar-app-by-metadream/  
- We got inspired by the Avatar and room functions in this app. We thought that we could integrate such a feature to motivate and push students to complete tasks and lesson activities. 
- We incorporated these features in MyWorkroom to allow for a creative space for students. They are free to express themselves through their choice of clothing on their Avatar and show it to their friends. This in turn can encourage other students to want to work hard and get such items as well.
