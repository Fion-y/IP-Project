# MyWorkroom

MyWorkroom is an educational platform that seeks to inspire and push students to collaborate and build relationships with their peers. With the freedom to customise their own Avatar, students will be motivated to finish their activities quickly. With each completed activity, they gain stars which they can exchange for clothing for their Avatar. They also gradually unlock furniture in their rooms with each task. This excites them since they do not know what they will unlock next.  
 
## Design Process

 This website's colour palette leans towards pastels and cool colours. Upon doing research, we found that blue was a colour that stimulates productivity. On top of that, pastel colours are more pleasing and easier on the eyes. We decided on rounded edges as it was not harsh on users. We kept our user's age range in mind and strived towards a minimalistic looking website, without too much graphics but at the same time, attracting students to use it often.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
### User Stories
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
- As a student, I want to use a platform that will motivate me, so that I can get more work done.
- As a competitive student, I want to be able to know where I stand among those in my cohort, so that I can keep improving on my studies.
- As a creative student, I would use this platform so that I can have freedom to casually express my creativity.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
