## Design Process
 
For the design, the main theme wanted to go with was gradient and trying to use colors that promotes a feeling of peace and calmness.
We decided to use the radial gradient design as it is usually used in graphics that promotes meditation and calmness.
At the start of the project, we wanted to implement the design of kindergarten assets like crayons and very straightforward visuals but then we realise
it doesnt align with our ideas.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
